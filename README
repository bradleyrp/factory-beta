todo as of 2016.1.15

1. add homology modeling to automacs / make sure that there is a callback to add the PDB
2. implement a search function to identify possibly out-of-date calculations and delete them
3. fix paths in omni and connect.py because they are relative to mplxr not calc/dev and also data spots must be a list!

immediate todo for 2016.1.25

send calculations to celery worker
visualize the ongoing calculations somehow
decide how to visualize (many) slices
get rid of collection selections upon group creation/update
consider making make compute dry an automatic thing for debugging?

todolist kindof
add extra_calculation models
write them to meta
note that we will have to add new meta files somewhere (in deploy when git clone happens or directly in omnicalc)
tell omnicalc to add extracalcs to calcs always
make forms for calculations exactly as collections/groups
note that we will have to load the calcs (colors.py figures.py plot-protein_rmsd.py protein_rmsd.py) somewhere
run make plot for all plots associated with extracalcs (or autocalcs) after make compute
but note that we may wish to model the plots
set up automatic RMSD plots that look good
write a view which links PNGs to the database
start outlining three test cases (ptdins cgmd bilayers joe's data)
create the git repo for testing

calculations:
  protein_rmsd:
    uptype: simulation
    slice_name: lengthy
    group: all
    collections: one
plots:
  protein_rmsd:
    uptype: post
    calculation: protein_rmsd
    slices: lengthy
    collections: 
      - one

SUPER IMPORTANT DESIGN CONSIDERATION

imagine that you make slices with "all" but not "protein"
later you try to do a calculation on that slice_name with group protein
but the slice doesn't exist! so it will fail
