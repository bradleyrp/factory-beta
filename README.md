FACTORY
=======

The "factory" codes provide a browser-based interface for [AUTOMACS](https://github.com/bradleyrp/automacs) (simulation) and [OMNICALC](https://github.com/bradleyrp/omnicalc) (analysis) codes in order to scale molecular biophysical modeling projects to hundreds of simulations, easily reproduce calculations on these data, and easily share the underlying code.

Requires
--------

This package requires a typical linux-based operating system with scientific packages (e.g. Python's scipy), GROMACS for running simulations, and a few other requirements outlined in the installation instructions given by ``make help``. Most linux installations provide the required software via the package manager.
	
Installation
------------

Download and run ``make help`` for instructions. More documentation coming soon.
