=======

The "factory" codes provide a browser-based interface for [AUTOMACS](https://github.com/bradleyrp/automacs) (simulation) and [OMNICALC](https://github.com/bradleyrp/omnicalc) (analysis) codes in order to scale molecular biophysical modeling projects to hundreds of simulations, easily reproduce calculations on these data, and easily share the underlying code.
